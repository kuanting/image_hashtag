# HADES: HAshtag Recommendation via DEep Learning for Images in Social Networks
[HADES](http://www.imagehashtag.com/)(HAshtag recommendation system via DEep learning for images in Social networks) is a recommendation system that users can upload images and receive 10 most relevant hashtags based on the content of the image. The homepage of HADES is shown below. In HADES, we develop several methods to effectively combine image classifiers and NLP models. Besides, HADES can crawl and learn latest tags online, collect user feedback, and automatically update its image classifiers as well as hashtag embedding.
